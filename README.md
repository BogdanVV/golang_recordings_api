# WTF AM I SEEING HERE?

That's a project I'm using for learning Golang.

It's a simple CRUD API where you can operate with vintage vinyl albums. This brilliant idea isn't mine since it's coming from go.dev site in one of their learning resources.

This project is using `gin` package for handling routes.

Also, I'm using MySQL here for storing data. Soon (I hope) there's gonna be a Docker container with this MySQL db to quickly install this whole thing.

There's also a `create-tables.sql` file which you can run from `mysql` terminal which you can open by running

```bash
$ mysql -u root -p
```

after you installed MySQL on your machine.

This monster can be started by running

```bash
$ go run .
```

in the root directory of this project.

I'm missing a lot of stuff here so most likely you're not gonna be able to start this project by following this readme. But still you can enjoy looking at my outstanding code.
